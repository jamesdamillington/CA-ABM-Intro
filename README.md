# Introduction to spatial simulation using NetLogo

Dr James Millington | https://landscapemodelling.net/

A collection of NetLogo models to demonstrate how spatial processes can be quickly simulated and explored using the NetLogo modelling environment.

Tutorials are provided using some of the NetLogo model files in this repository:
- [Landscapes](/Landscapes/Landscapes-Tutorial.md)
- [Schelling](/Schelling/Schelling-Tutorial.md)
