# CA-ABM-Intro

## Introduction to spatial simulation (CA and ABM) using NetLogo

Dr James Millington | https://landscapemodelling.net/

A collection of NetLogo models to demonstrate how spatial processes can be quickly simulated and explored using the NetLogo modelling environment.

Tutorials are provided (and will be added) using some of the model files in this repository:
- [Landscapes](/Landscapes/Landscapes-Tutorial.md)
- [Schelling](/Schelling/Schelling-Tutorial.md)
